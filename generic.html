							<p>After gaining experience as an administrative head, I discovered my passion for cybersecurity and decided to make a career change. Despite not having prior knowledge of the field, I was determined to achieve my ultimate goal of becoming a cybersecurity analyst.

								To achieve this goal, I created a strategic roadmap to acquire the skills and knowledge necessary for the field. The roadmap began with learning a programming language, and I chose Python due to its versatility and widespread use in the field. I spent several months learning the language and its various applications.
								
								Next, I moved on to web development, as it was essential to have an understanding of website architecture to ensure their security. I studied HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to gain expertise in front-end web development, and I also learned back-end programming using Python's Django web framework.
								
								Linux was another critical component of my roadmap, as it is widely used in the field of cybersecurity. I gained proficiency in using the Linux command line interface, learned shell scripting, and familiarized myself with Linux-based tools for networking, security, and system administration.
								
								Finally, I focused on ethical hacking and cybersecurity analysis, taking courses and acquiring certifications to gain hands-on experience with tools and techniques used in the field. This included vulnerability scanning, penetration testing, network security, and incident response.
								
								Overall, my strategic roadmap was a comprehensive plan to acquire the skills and knowledge necessary for success in the cybersecurity field. I pursued each step with dedication and persistence, and the result was a well-rounded foundation of technical skills and expertise that have served me well in my career as a cybersecurity analyst.

							<h1 class="mayor">PROGRAMMING</h1>
							<br>
							<p>I began my journey in Python programming by enrolling in the Google IT Automation with Python program. This introductory course provided me with a solid foundation in Python programming and helped me understand the basics of automation.

								However, to further advance my skills, I decided to take a more comprehensive course in Python programming. I enrolled in the 52 Weeks of Python course, which was a rigorous 52-week program that covered all aspects of Python programming. Through this program, I gained in-depth knowledge of Python and became a proficient Python programmer.
								
								During the 52 Weeks of Python course, I had the opportunity to create a Rest API using various open-source software such as Flask, SQL Alchemy, NAPALM, ncclient, scapy, and nmap. I also developed proficiency in various topics related to the implementation of the app, including operational overview, discovery, device communication, monitoring (HTTPS, DNS, NTP), REST API development (user interface, devices, workers), database table creation, and worker communication (messaging, such as rabbitmq and HTTP).
								
								Overall, the Google IT Automation with Python program was an excellent starting point for my Python journey, but the 52 Weeks of Python course helped me advance my skills and become a proficient Python programmer.
								After completing the 52 Weeks of Python course, I continued to hone my skills and gained practical experience as a Python programmer. I worked as a freelancer and took on various Python scripting projects, such as creating connections to MongoDB and developing automated scripts for data processing.

These projects allowed me to apply my Python programming skills to real-world problems and gain a deeper understanding of the language. They also helped me develop a range of valuable soft skills, including time management, communication, and problem-solving.

Overall, my experience in Python programming has been enriching and rewarding. From starting with the Google IT Automation with Python program to becoming a proficient Python programmer through the 52 Weeks of Python course, to working as a freelancer, my journey in Python programming has been a fulfilling one. In addition to this, I have also had the opportunity to gain experience in other programming languages such as Java, Go, and SQL.

								<br>
								<p>As a cybersecurity professional, I am pleased to have finally started my journey in this constantly evolving field. I have taken several courses, including The Complete Ethical Hacking Course, IBM Cybersecurity Analyst, and Wireshark: Packet Analysis and Ethical Hacking, which have equipped me with essential skills such as vulnerability assessment, penetration testing, and network security. However, I am aware that this is just the beginning of a never-ending learning path, which I am truly passionate about. I am always eager to learn about new vulnerabilities and keep myself updated with the latest tools and techniques, such as using Kali Linux, learning Google Cloud, and obtaining relevant badges.

									Furthermore, I have participated in Bug Bounty programs, such as Integrity, to gain practical experience in identifying and mitigating security vulnerabilities. As a cybersecurity professional, I understand that practical experience is crucial in enhancing one's understanding of the cybersecurity landscape, and I am dedicated to continuously improving my skills and knowledge to stay ahead of the curve.
									
									In addition to my technical expertise, I possess strong communication and collaboration skills, which enable me to effectively communicate technical information to non-technical stakeholders. I am committed to conducting cybersecurity activities in an ethical and responsible manner, adhering to the highest ethical standards to maintain the trust of clients, stakeholders, and society at large.
									
									Overall, I am excited about the limitless possibilities that await me in this field, and I am confident that my technical skills, communication abilities, and commitment to ethical practices make me a valuable asset to any organization.
